# What is VGC?
VGC is a 3D game engine that I started making a few years ago. The engine has some pretty nifty features such as: 

* Real-time WYSIWYG editing
* Collision detection
* Multiplayer support
* BASIC scripting utilising object oriented (OO) programming methods
* Roughly 200 functions which are constantly being improved to make scripting for VGC easy as pie
* Built-in GUI controls for windows, panels, labels, buttons and text boxes with customisable themes
* All functions at full complexity available for each entity no matter how minor
* Built with FPS, RPG, Action and adventure genres in mind, but with full scripting there really is no limit

The editor for VGC is actually built on top of the VGC engine. This means that the editor can run a scene whilst you are working on it. You can fully interact with items both as a player and as an editor.

Below is a video created years ago showing an early version of VGC with it's real-time scripting support:

# Whatâ€™s next?

VGC has been sitting on a backup drive for several years now and it seems a shame that an engine that I spent so much time on is being left.

It's quite obsolote now with the likes of Godot, Lumberyard and Unity.
